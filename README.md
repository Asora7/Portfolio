## Getting Started
Make sure you have git installed.


### Installing

Ensure You Have Git Installed:

You can either use the terminal to install or the website:

- Visit the Website: Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads using your web browser.

- Download Installer: On the Git Downloads page, you'll see options to download Git for different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.). Choose the appropriate installer for your macOS system.

- Run the Installer: Once the download completes, locate the downloaded installer file (usually named something like git-<version>-intel-universal-mavericks.dmg for macOS).

- Install Git: Double-click the downloaded .dmg file to open it. Then, drag the Git icon into the Applications folder to install it. This will copy Git and its associated tools to your system.

- Verify Installation: After installation, open Terminal and type git --version to verify that Git has been installed correctly. It should display the version of Git installed on your system.


Installing in terminal:


1. If you don't have Homebrew installed, first install Homebrew by running:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

3. Open Terminal and type the following command:

```bash
brew install git
```

4. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Asora7/Portfolio.git
```

5. Navigate to the Project Directory:
   
```bash
cd Portfolio
```

6. Viewing the Project:

```bash
open index.html
```

- View github repository: https://github.com/Asora7/Portfolio.git
- View deployed link: https://asoraportfolio.netlify.app


7. Locate the Portfolio folder locally on your computer:

After cloning, the Portfolio folder should be located in your current directory. If you need to locate it:

- On macOS/Linux: You can navigate to the folder where you cloned the project using your file explorer or terminal. Typically, it will be in your home directory or the directory from where you ran the git clone command.
  
- On Windows: Similarly, use File Explorer to navigate to the folder where you cloned the project. This is typically in your user directory or the directory you specified when cloning.
  
- Once you locate the Portfolio folder, you can open it to access all project files, including index.html.


8. Open in VS code:

To open the project in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), follow these steps:

- Launch Visual Studio Code on your computer.
- In VS Code, go to File > Open Folder....
- Navigate to the location where you cloned the Portfolio repository.
- Select the Portfolio folder and click Open.
- Once the project is open in VS Code, you can navigate through the files in the Explorer sidebar and edit them as needed.
